  abstract = {Abstract             Stock-recruitment relationships (SRRs) may differ substantially among environmental regimes. We developed a methodology including a Hidden Markov Stock-recruitment Model (HMSM), the maximum likelihood approach and a model selection procedure to identify abrupt changes of stock-recruitment (SR) dynamics. This method allows us to objectively identify the unobserved regimes, estimate regime-specific parameters, and predict the transition probabilities among regimes. First, we used simulation to verify that our method could identify the correct number of regimes and estimate the model parameters well. Then, we applied the models to an Atlantic cod stock on the southern Grand Bank off Newfoundland, Canada. Results indicated that the HMSM assuming 2 regimes performed the best, and the cod stock shifted to a regime characterized with lower productivity and higher density dependence in late 1980s.~Additionally, the estimated probability to return to the previous high-productivity regime was very low, suggesting the cod stock may remain at the low-productivity regime for a prolonged period. Overall, we consider the methodology proposed in this paper as a useful tool to model regime shifts of SRRs in fisheries stock assessment.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Hierarchical models can express ecological dynamics using a combination of fixed and random effects, and measurement of their complexity (effective degrees of freedom, EDF) requires estimating how much random effects are shrunk toward a shared mean. Estimating EDF is helpful to (1) penalize complexity during model selection and (2) to improve understanding of model behavior. I applied the conditional Akaike Information Criterion (cAIC) to estimate EDF from the finite-difference approximation to the gradient of model predictions with respect to each datum. I confirmed that this has similar behavior to widely used Bayesian criteria, and I illustrated ecological applications using three case studies. The first compared model parsimony with or without time-varying parameters when predicting density-dependent survival, where cAIC favors time-varying demographic parameters more than conventional Akaike Information Criterion. The second estimates EDF in a phylogenetic structural equation model, and identifies a larger EDF when predicting longevity than mortality rates in fishes. The third compares EDF for a species distribution model fitted for 20 bird species and identifies those species requiring more model complexity. These highlight the ecological and statistical insight from comparing EDF among experimental units, models, and data partitions, using an approach that can be broadly adopted for nonlinear ecological models.},

  abstract = {Functional relationships, such as stock--recruitment curves, are generally estimated from time series data where natural "random" factors have generated both deviations from the relationship and also informative variation in the independent variables. Even in the absence of measurement errors, such natural experiments can lead to severely biased parameter estimates. For stock--recruitment models, the bias is misleading for management: the stock will appear too productive when it is low, and too unproductive when it is large. The likely magnitude of such biases can and should be determined for any particular case by Monte Carlo simulations.},
